# Second Brain System

![Limitless Logo](assets/limitless-logo.svg)

## Overview

Second Brain System is a modern, intelligent platform designed to help you collect, analyze, and summarize your daily digital life using LLM-powered tools and the Limitless API. This project provides code examples, notebooks, and utilities for working with transcripts, lifelogs, and more.

## Features
- **API Integration**: Easily connect to the Limitless API for lifelog and transcript management.
- **LLM Summarization**: Use OpenAI models to generate daily summaries from your transcripts.
- **Data Export**: Export lifelogs and transcripts to Markdown or other formats.
- **Visualization**: Notebooks and assets for visualizing your data (see `notebooks/` and `assets/`).
- **Extensible Examples**: Modular Python scripts for various lifelog and transcript workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- [Limitless API Key](https://limitless.ai/developers)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/)

### Installation
```bash
cd examples
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Authentication
Set your API keys as environment variables:
```bash
export LIMITLESS_API_KEY="your_limitless_api_key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

## Usage

### Export Markdown
Export the most recent lifelog record to Markdown:
```bash
LIMITLESS_API_KEY="your_api_key" python export_markdown.py
```

### Summarize Daily Transcripts
Generate a daily summary using OpenAI:
```bash
LIMITLESS_API_KEY="your_api_key" OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key" python summarize_day.py
```

### Notebooks
Explore the `notebooks/` directory for Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data analysis and visualization.
